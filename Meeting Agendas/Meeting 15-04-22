Jacob and Joakim made an algorithm, and implemented it, for the ball’s damage when a wall collision occurs.

Johan continued working on the map editor.


3. Discussion items (35 min)
Discussions regarding the PMD plugin, FindBugs and Code coverage.

PMD is working (we think). IntelliJ has internal code coverage which can generate code coverage reports.
Problems with testing the Ball class because JUnit cannot create textures.
