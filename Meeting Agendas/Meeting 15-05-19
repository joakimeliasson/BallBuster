  Date: 2015-05-19

  Facilitator: Johan Segerlund

  Participants: Matthias Andersson, Jacob Lundberg, Joakim Eliasson

1. Objectives (5 min).
Write UML, SDD, RAD, Discuss what needs to be done in the project.


2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
Matthias have implemented a menu where you can start the game and change keybinds.
Joakim have implemented healthpacks and done network research.
Jacob implemented sound, made some grafic designs and done network research.
Johan implemented a hud that views hp and mana and done network research.

3. Discussion items (35 min)

We feel that we are getting closer to our goal, we have discusses network, some TODOS and extra features we can implement.
SDD and RAD is almost complete. We looked into how to create an UML and from what we could see, it would be very big and hard to write by hand.

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

We looked into network and decided not to implement it in our game. We think it will need to much work since our game is not build to handle network.
We would have to rebuild the system in order to make it work and we would rather put our remaning time to polish and make our game complete.

Stuff that needs to be done:
UML

Stuff that we can add/change to the game:
Add Music
Adjust the menu
Add more maps
Clean the code
Win Condition
Move some stuff from Ballbuster to view and controller
Visual Design(lightning)

Bugs:
Shield bug, the shield is very large when a collision happens
Healthpacks spawns inside tiles


5. Wrap up
UML needs to be done
Johan is gonna work with lightning
Matthias will adjust the menu
